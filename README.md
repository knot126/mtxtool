# MTXTool

MTXTool (and MTX2PNG) is a utility to convert MTX files to and from PNGs.

## Usage

```bash
./mtxtool (mode) (input) (output)
./mtx2png (input) (mode)
```

## Compiling

This project is only known to compile under linux; however, it may be able to compile under windows.

### Linux

Run this:

```
./compile.sh
```

to compile both MTXTool (Note: partially broken) and MTX2PNG (mostly working).
